# Parallel-Distributed-Processing
An introduction to Parallel and Distributed paradigms, architectures, and algorithms, and the analytical tools, environments, and languages needed to support these paradigms. Examples inspired from biology and other CS algorithm systems. 

parallel or distributed programs in three contexts -- 
(1) multi-threaded programming with POSIX threads 
(2) general purpose computing on a graphics processing unit 
(3) MPI proamming on a cluster.
