***** Project

Tasks>

All my code is pretty much the same, with the additions from project one files added as well. This includes read & write binary files. I did not modify most of the code except make corrections where errors were and from the emails and project and my tests all worked well, being fairly similar to Stephanieâ€™s expected outputs as outlined.For this project I created no new files, all methods and structs were added to the standard phase_support and sim files. My code ran well on the node, but I could not get disp_phase to compile outside the node.   

Scap.c & phase_support2.c are my methods which I stored alternate methods in, for later use. These should be ignored.   

*****Extensions

Since late, I did no extensions
