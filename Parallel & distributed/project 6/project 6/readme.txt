Tasks>

I created the three required files : fish_production_single.c , fish_production_batch.c and fish_production_multiple.c. I also attached the excel data for my tests.   

*****Extensions

Since late, I did no extensions. However please read my report, I spent a lot of time on a feature that I did not know was not needed and thought that work might be appreciated.
